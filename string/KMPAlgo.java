/* KMP is a pattern searching algorithm which gives O(m+n) instead of O(m*n) in case of brute force
 * 
 * The basic idea behind KMPâ€™s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), 
 * we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. 
 * We take advantage of this information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match.
 * 
 * We compare first window of txt with pat
	txt = "AAAAABAAABA" 
	pat = "AAAA"  [Initial position]
	We find a match. This is same as Naive String Matching.
	
	In the next step, we compare next window of txt with pat.
	txt = "AAAAABAAABA" 
	pat =  "AAAA" [Pattern shifted one position]
	This is where KMP does optimization over Naive. In this 
	second window, we only compare fourth A of pattern
	with fourth character of current window of text to decide 
	whether current window matches or not. Since we know 
	first three characters will anyway match, we skipped 
	matching first three characters. 
	
	Need of Preprocessing?
	An important question arises from the above explanation, 
	how to know how many characters to be skipped. To know this, 
	we pre-process pattern and prepare an integer array 
	lps[] that tells us the count of characters to be skipped.
